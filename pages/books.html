    <h1>Self Development Books</h1>

    <p> Self development, personal development or self help books 
        (however you like to call them), are mostly about useful
        concepts from psychology and philosophy. Instead of having
        to take classes in these subjects and read scientific articles,
        I like to read books that are easily applicable to my life
        and are enjoyable to read. One author whose blog and books I've
        always liked is <a href="https://markmanson.net/" target="blank">Mark Manson</a>.
