    <h1>DJing</h1>
    <p> I love to DJ as a hobby because it makes you very present and creative.
        It teaches you to improvize on the fly and gives you a good ear and taste
        for different music. My favourite genres are deep house, techno and
        drum &amp; bass. Learn more about the art of DJing
